Payday, pawnshop and car title loans can provide immediate access to cash, but their high fees and short repayment periods can make it difficult to repay on time. Consumer advocates caution against using these quick-cash, no-credit-check loans.
Payday loans

A payday loan lets you borrow a small amount, typically $500 or less, with the intention of repaying the loan plus a fee, by your next payday. Fees generally range from $10 to $30 per $100 borrowed over a short two-week term, pushing the APR for this type of loan into the triple digits.
