Many lenders allow borrowers to apply for loans online. Doing so speeds up the approval process because you don’t have to visit the lender and wait for a loan officer to submit your application.

If you run into issues when applying for a loan online, contact the lender’s customer service department via phone, email or chat.
5. Avoid errors on your loan application

Having incorrect information, including typos, on your loan application can slow down the approval process. Double-check that everything is correct before submitting your application, so the lender doesn’t have to ask you to fix any mistakes.
